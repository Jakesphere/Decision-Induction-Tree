This project is decision induction tree which is a classifier that can categorize large data sets. My classifier was able to work with 80% classification accuracy

You can refer to my report if you need clarification "ESE 327 Project 2 report"

IMPORTANT: when using my code, you have to make sure that 
line 414 is set to either start or end. This is the class column of yur dataset. 
line 461 is set to a number <= total rows in your dataset (This number
will divide your data set in half, every row before split is used as the test set, 
every row after is used to generate the induction tree). 

My source code is decision_tree.cpp

I have attached some testbenches so you can try out the code yourself.
